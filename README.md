# Chat-room-client

This chat-room application is a place to talk to and keep in touch with friends!
Users can join and make chat-rooms to socialize, plan, and work. It
integrates socket.io, a third party application, that allows the server to
'listen' for messages coming from certain rooms and then send out those messages
to users who are also listening on those rooms. It runs on node.js and express
for its user interface and functionality.
